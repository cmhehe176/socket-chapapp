# Chat app with socket using mutilthread and built by client/server model

Socket packet in Java doesn't support us with thread management so I write some more classes in this project to handle that.
I was inspired by socket.io - a library in the other programming landguage (Javascript). On it, there are many avaiable methods to handle mutil-client connect to server.
# Program functions list
